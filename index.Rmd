# Heading 1
This is my first r-markdown file
I will knit it to a browser

<!-- This is a r-markdown comment -->

This is how to **bold** a text
This is how to produce an *italics*
\  <!--This is how to introduce a line break-->
This line now has a break above it but not below.

## Challenge 1

### Survey sheds light on the 'crisis' rocking research.

**More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments**, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature*'s survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research.

The data reveal sometimes-contradictory attitudes towards reproducibility. Although 52% of those surveyed agree that there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is probably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature.

### The Survey

In the survey[^2] respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibility in science. Below is the list order by the most highly rated:

* Better understanding of statistics
* Better mentoring/supervision
* More robust design
* Better teaching
* More within-lab validation
* Incentives for better practice
* Incentives for formal reproduction
* More external-lab validation
* More time for mentoring
* Journals enforcing standards
* More time checking notebooks [internal_link2](#internal_link2)



## Creatiing tables

Use |and - to create a table as follows:

| Column 1    | Column 2    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Item 1,1    | Item 1,2    |
| Item 2,1    | Item 2,2    |


Table alignments can be done using the following syntax:

| Left align  | Center align | Right align  |
| :---        |    :----:    |         ---: |
| Item 1,1    | Item 1,2     | Item 1,3     | 
| Item 2,1    | Item 2,2     | Item 2,3     |


## Creatiing blocks
I want to add a block

> Here is my block


## Creatiing code blocks

```
print("Hello world")
x <- 1+2
print(x)
```
